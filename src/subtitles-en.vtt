Hello, welcome to Overview of Web
and Cloud Development.

2
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.680
When you’re starting out as a Web Developer,
it can be difficult to determine what you

3
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.380
need to learn and what order you should learn
it in.

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.040
Understanding how familiar websites are constructed and

5
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.320
delivered to you is a good starting point.

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.340
Let’s review the basics of how you interact
with a website.

7
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.180
You launch an internet browser – there are
lots available:

8
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.780
Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox,
and Apple Safari are some of the most popular.

9
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.940
The browser has an address bar, into which
you enter a URL, like www.IBM.com.

10
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.940
The browser then contacts the server with
the name and requests the information that

11
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.020
makes up the website.

12
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.720
The server then sends a response, which contains
the data that the client requires to display

13
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.500
the website.

14
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.860
For most websites, the server will return:

15
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.380
HTML, which defines the structure of the page,
but doesn’t look very attractive

16
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.120
CSS, which adds style and flair to the page
and JavaScript, which adds interactivity and

17
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.402
dynamic content.

18
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.440
Content displayed by websites can contain
elements that are either previously stored

19
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.620
on the server (called “static”) or generated
each time they are requested by the client

20
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.600
(called “dynamic”).

21
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.360
Dynamic elements can involve information coming
from other systems and applications, such

22
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.522
as databases.

23
00:01:40.677 --> 00:01:46.497
Most websites contain static and dynamic elements
to provide the best user experience.

24
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.560
Cloud Applications are similar to Websites
in that they request content that a server

25
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.362
returns.

26
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:59.940
Cloud Apps are built to work seamlessly with
a Cloud-based back-end infrastructure, Cloud-based

27
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.520
data storage and data processing, and other
Cloud services, making them very scalable

28
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.440
and very resilient.

29
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.980
The environment for building websites and
Cloud Applications is divided into two primary

30
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.580
areas:

31
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.440
front-end and back-end.

32
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.740
The front-end deals with everything that happens
at the client-side – everything the user

33
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.480
can see and interact with.

34
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.680
You can choose to specialize in front-end
coding, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and related

35
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.780
frameworks, libraries, and tools.

36
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.260
The back-end deals with everything that happens
on the server before the code and data are

37
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.469
sent to the client.

38
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.520
The back-end coding usually handles the logic
and functionality that make the website or

39
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.320
app work, and the authentication processes
that keep data secure.

40
00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.240
Back-end developers may also work with relational
or noSQL databases, even collaborating with

41
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.880
database administrators in bigger projects.

42
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.840
Full-stack developers have skills, knowledge,
and experience in both front-end and back-end

43
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.620
environments.

44
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.740
Whichever way you choose to specialize, you
will need the appropriate tools to help you work.

45
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.500
The first tool most developers add to their
resources is a code editor.

46
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.600
Developers also need tools to integrate, build,
compile, and debug code.

47
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.620
Integrated Development Environments or IDEs
incorporate some of these additional capabilities

48
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.480
beyond just code editing and make it easier
to build and manage your code.

49
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.740
Good IDEs support multiple languages and integrate
with management and storage tools like Git

50
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.400
and GitHub.

51
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.440
Other useful features are custom extensions
and themes for supporting your working style

52
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.520
and environment.

53
00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:02.160
Examples for code editors and IDEs include
Sublime Text, Atom, Vim, VS Code, Visual Studio,

54
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.260
Eclipse and NetBeans.

55
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.100
In this brief overview, you learned about:

56
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.400
The basic communication between client and
servers.

57
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.740
How websites are built and displayed.

58
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.820
Front-end development is about what happens
on the client side.

59
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.660
Back-end development is about what happens
on the server.

60
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.460
Full-stack development incudes both front-end
and back-end development.

61
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.120
IDEs will help you create and manage your code.
