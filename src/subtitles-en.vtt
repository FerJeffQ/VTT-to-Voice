Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: Aspects of the Web Development Lifecycle.

2
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.500
In this video, we will listen to several
web development professionals discuss

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.320
the aspects in the lifecycle of web development.

4
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:24.780
So, what are your most and least favorite
aspects in the lifecycle of web development

5
00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:28.918
(from conception to development and
testing, deployment, and maintenance)

6
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.420
Hello, everyone, my name is Upkar Lidder
and I'm a developer advocate with IBM.

7
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.560
So I will not call it my
least favorite by any means.

8
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.780
But as a developer, I'm very keen to
start developing to start writing code.

9
00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:48.960
There is a lot of, there's a lot of things that
happen before you write that first piece of code.

10
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.260
And that could be design thinking workshops,

11
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.640
getting user requirements,

12
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.960
sprint planning, etc.

13
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.600
So as a developer, I'm always eager
to bypass those things and get into

14
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.820
the actual development of the application.

15
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:08.040
My favorite thing about application development
is actually deploying the application

16
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.700
or an app in handing it to the end user
and see how it makes their lives easier,

17
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.500
it makes their jobs more effective.

18
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.060
Hello there, my name is Bradley Steinfeld.

19
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.860
I am a software architect and I work
for IBM Cloud and cognitive software.

20
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.740
So as a software architect, I
think my favorite part of the

21
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.860
cloud app development lifecycle
is probably the conception part,

22
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.060
the architecture part,

23
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.540
and kind of putting it together
how we're going to build this app.

24
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.400
What services are we going to use?

25
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.180
What different types of technologies
we need to at the end of the day,

26
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.560
deliver what the stakeholder needs
and do it in the best way we can.

27
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.020
Cheapest we can so on and so forth.

28
00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.900
My least favorite is probably testing.

29
00:01:55.218 --> 00:01:58.260
It's not the most fun to discover bugs and

30
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.960
then fix them but at the end of
the day, it's a necessary part.

31
00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:04.043
So there you go.

32
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.200
I am Dennis Harvey.

33
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.760
I work at Coursera as a content
strategy manager for cloud technology.

34
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.740
Conception and development is always exciting--
to see an idea morph into reality.

35
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.020
Testing can be interesting
for QA-oriented professionals.

36
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.180
Deployment can also be challenging if
you incorporate automated deployment

37
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.880
which would be a best practice at this point.

38
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.580
And maintenance is possibly nobody's favorite,
but it is critical and often under-emphasized.
